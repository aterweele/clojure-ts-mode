Instructions for releasing a new version.

Review the ## main (unreleased) heading in CHANGELOG.md. Add links to commits
for each entry so users can reference them. Add a thank you note for entries
contributed by people who are not primary maintainers.

Add a new heading in the CHANGELOG.md file corresponding to the next version
number. Following this the ## main (unreleased) heading should be empty

Update clojure-ts-mode.el Version: property in the package comment at the top of
the file to match the upcomming version number.

Create a new commit on main branch with all the above changes.

Add a new tag for the corresponding version on the commit just created. This is
needed by MELPA. The tag should follow the format (without quotes) "vM.m.p"
where M is the major number, m is the minor number, and p is the patch number.
The tag should have a comment referring readers to the CHANGELOG.md file. It
should read something like

    Release v.M.m.p

    See CHANGELOG.md for more details

Make sure gpg signing is enabled when creating the commit and tags.
