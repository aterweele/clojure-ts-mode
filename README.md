# Clojure Tree-Sitter Mode

`clojure-ts-mode` is an Emacs major mode that provides font-lock (syntax
highlighting), indentation, and navigation support for the
[Clojure(Script) programming language](http://clojure.org), powered by the
[tree-sitter-clojure](https://github.com/sogaiu/tree-sitter-clojure)
[tree-sitter](https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/) grammar.

## Rationale

[clojure-mode](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/clojure-mode) has served us well
for a very long time, but it suffers from a few [long-standing
problems](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/clojure-mode#caveats), related to
Emacs limitations baked into its design. The introduction of built-in support
for Tree-sitter in Emacs 29 provides a natural opportunity to address many of
them. Enter `clojure-ts-mode`.

Keep in mind that the transition to `clojure-ts-mode` won't happen overnight for several reasons:

- getting to feature parity with `clojure-mode` will take some time
- tools that depend on `clojure-mode` will need to be updated to work with `clojure-ts-mode`
- we still need to support users of older Emacs versions that don't support Tree-sitter

That's why `clojure-ts-mode` is being developed independently of `clojure-mode` and will one day replace it when the time is right. (e.g. 3 major Emacs version down the road, so circa Emacs 32)

You can read more about the vision for `clojure-ts-mode` [here](https://metaredux.com/posts/2023/03/12/clojure-mode-meets-tree-sitter.html).

## Current Status

**This library is still under development. Breaking changes should be expected.**

You can track the current progress towards an initial release [here](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/clojure-ts-mode/issues/1).

## Installation

### Emacs 29

This package requires Emacs 29 built with tree-sitter support from the [emacs-29 branch](https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/emacs.git/log/?h=emacs-29).
As of right now, users must install Emacs from source with tree-sitter installed on their system.
More information on this can be found in the Emacs repository:
- [Emacs tree-sitter starter-guide](https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/emacs.git/tree/admin/notes/tree-sitter/starter-guide?h=emacs-29)
- [Emacs install instructions](https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/emacs.git/tree/INSTALL.REPO).

### Install clojure-ts-mode

clojure-ts-mode is available on [Melpa](https://melpa.org/#/clojure-ts-mode).
It can be installed with

``` emacs-lisp
(package-install 'clojure-ts-mode)
```

#### package-vc

Emacs 29 also includes `package-vc-install`, so you can run

``` emacs-lisp
(package-vc-install "https://github.com/clojure-emacs/clojure-ts-mode")
```

to install this package from source.

#### Manual installation

You can install it by cloning the repository and adding it to your load path.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/clojure-emacs/clojure-ts-mode.git
```

```emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "~/path/to/clojure-ts-mode/")
```

Once installed, evaluate clojure-ts-mode.el and you should be ready to go.

### Install libtree-sitter-clojure shared library

The tree-sitter clojure shared library must be available to Emacs.
If you have `git` and a C compiler (`cc`) available on your system's `PATH`, **then these steps are not necessary**.
clojure-ts-mode will install the grammar when you first open a Clojure file.

If clojure-ts-mode fails to automatically install the grammar, you have the option to install it manually.
All you need is `git` and a C compiler (GCC works well).

To start, clone [tree-sitter-clojure](https://github.com/sogaiu/tree-sitter-clojure).

Then run the following code (depending on your OS) from the tree-sitter-clojure repository on your machine.

#### Linux

```bash
mkdir -p dist
cc -c -I./src src/parser.c -o "parser.o"
cc -fPIC -shared src/parser.o -o "dist/libtree-sitter-clojure.so"
```

#### macOS

```bash
mkdir -p dist
cc -c -I./src src/parser.c -o "parser.o"
cc -fPIC -shared src/parser.o -o "dist/libtree-sitter-clojure.dylib"
```

#### Windows

I don't know how to do this on Windows. Patches welcome!

#### Finally, in emacs

Then tell Emacs where to find the shared library by adding something like this to your init file

```emacs-lisp
(setq treesit-extra-load-path '( "~/path/to/tree-sitter-clojure/dist"))
```

OR you can move the `libtree-sitter-clojure.so`/`libtree-sitter-clojure.dylib` to a directory named `tree-sitter`
under your `user-emacs-directory` (typically `~/.emacs.d` on Unix systems).
